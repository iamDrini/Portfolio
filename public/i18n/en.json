Furthermore, should more specific legal bases be relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.</p><ul><li><strong>Consent (Art. 6 (1) (1) (a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li><li><strong>Performance of a Contract and Pre-contractual Inquiries (Art. 6 (1) (1) (b) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</li><li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.</li></ul><p><strong>National Data Protection Regulations in Germany: </strong>In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. This specifically includes the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act – BDSG). The BDSG contains, in particular, special regulations on the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and transmission as well as automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p><h2 id='security'>Security Measures</h2><p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs, and the nature, scope, circumstances, and purposes of processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.</p><p>The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, entry, transfer, securing of availability and its separation. Furthermore, we have established procedures that ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data threats. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software, and procedures, in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through privacy-friendly default settings.</p><p>Securing online connections through TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect user data transmitted via our online services from unauthorized access, we use TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the Internet. These technologies encrypt information transmitted between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), thereby protecting the data from unauthorized access. TLS, as the further developed and more secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transfers meet the highest security standards. When a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate, this is signaled by the display of HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator for users that their data is being transmitted securely and encrypted.</p><h2 id='transfer'>Transfer of Personal Data</h2><p>In the context of our processing of personal data, it happens that it is transferred to other offices, companies, legally independent organizational units, or persons or disclosed to them. Recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude corresponding contracts or agreements that serve the protection of your data with the recipients of your data.</p><h2 id='international'>International Data Transfers</h2><p>Data processing in third countries: If we transfer data to a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if this occurs in the context of using third-party services or disclosing or transferring data to other persons, offices, or companies (which becomes recognizable by the postal address of the respective provider or if the privacy policy explicitly refers to the data transfer to third countries), this is always done in accordance with the legal requirements.</p><p>For data transfers to the USA, we primarily rely on the Data Privacy Framework (DPF), which was recognized as a secure legal framework by an adequacy decision of the EU Commission on July 10, 2023. Additionally, we have concluded standard contractual clauses with the respective providers, which correspond to the specifications of the EU Commission and establish contractual obligations to protect your data.</p><p>This dual safeguard ensures comprehensive protection of your data: the DPF forms the primary level of protection, while the standard contractual clauses serve as additional security. Should changes occur within the framework of the DPF, the standard contractual clauses act as a reliable fallback option. In this way, we ensure that your data remains appropriately protected even in the event of political or legal changes.</p><p>For individual service providers, we inform you whether they are certified according to the DPF and whether standard contractual clauses exist. Further information on the DPF and a list of certified companies can be found on the website of the US Department of Commerce at <a href='https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/' target='_blank'>https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</a>.</p><p>For data transfers to other third countries, corresponding security measures apply, in particular standard contractual clauses, explicit consent, or legally required transfers. Information on third-country transfers and applicable adequacy decisions can be found in the information offer of the EU Commission: <a href='https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de' target='_blank'>https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de.</a></p><h2 id='storage'>General Information on Data Storage and Deletion</h2><p>We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal regulations as soon as the underlying consents are revoked or no further legal bases for processing exist. This applies to cases where the original purpose of processing no longer exists or the data is no longer required. Exceptions to this rule exist if legal obligations or special interests require a longer retention or archiving of the data.</p><p>In particular, data that must be kept for commercial or tax law reasons or whose storage is necessary for legal enforcement or to protect the rights of other natural or legal persons must be archived accordingly.</p><p>Our privacy notices contain additional information on the retention and deletion of data that specifically apply to certain processing procedures.</p><p>If several details are given regarding the retention period or deletion periods of a piece of data, the longest period is always decisive. Data that is no longer kept for the originally intended purpose but due to legal requirements or other reasons is processed by us exclusively for the reasons justifying its retention.</p><p>Retention and Deletion of Data: The following general periods apply to retention and archiving according to German law:</p><ul><li>10 years - Retention period for books and records, annual financial statements, inventories, management reports, opening balance sheets, as well as the work instructions and other organizational documents required for their understanding (§ 147 para. 1 no. 1 in conjunction with para. 3 AO, § 14b para. 1 UStG, § 257 para. 1 no. 1 in conjunction with para. 4 HGB).</li><li>8 years - Accounting vouchers, such as e.g., invoices and cost receipts (§ 147 para. 1 no. 4 and 4a in conjunction with para. 3 sentence 1 AO and § 257 para. 1 no. 4 in conjunction with para. 4 HGB).</li><li>6 years - Other business documents: received commercial or business letters, reproductions of sent commercial or business letters, other documents as far as they are of importance for taxation, e.g. e.g., hourly wage slips, cost accounting sheets, calculation documents, price labeling, but also payroll documents as far as they are not already accounting vouchers and cash register tapes (§ 147 para. 1 no. 2, 3, 5 in conjunction with para. 3 AO, § 257 para. 1 no. 2 and 3 in conjunction with para. 4 HGB).</li><li>3 years - Data required to take into account potential warranty and damage claims or similar contractual claims and rights as well as to process related inquiries, based on past business experience and standard industry practices, are stored for the duration of the regular statutory limitation period of three years (§§ 195, 199 BGB).</li></ul><p>Start of Period at the End of the Year: If a period does not expressly start on a specific date and it is at least one year, it automatically starts at the end of the calendar year in which the event triggering the period occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in the context of which data is stored, the event triggering the period is the time the termination becomes effective or other termination of the legal relationship.</p><h2 id='rights'>Rights of Data Subjects</h2><p>Rights of Data Subjects under the GDPR: As a data subject under the GDPR, you have various rights, which arise in particular from Art. 15 to 21 GDPR:</p><ul><li><strong>Right to Object: You have the right, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you, which is based on Art. 6 (1) (e) or (f) GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.

The aforementioned data may also be processed for the purposes of detecting SPAM. We ask you to note that emails on the Internet are generally not sent encrypted. As a rule, emails are encrypted during transport, but (unless an end-to-end encryption method is used) not on the servers from which they are sent and received. We can therefore take no responsibility for the transmission path of the emails between the sender and the reception on our server; <span class=''><strong>Legal Bases:</strong> Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR).</span></li><li><strong>ALL-INKL: </strong>Services in the field of provision of information technology infrastructure and related services (e.g., storage space and/or computing capacities); <strong>Service Provider:</strong> ALL-INKL.COM - Neue Medien Münnich, Owner: René Münnich, Hauptstraße 68, 02742 Friedersdorf, Germany; <span class=''><strong>Legal Bases:</strong> Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR); </span><strong>Website:</strong> <a href='https://all-inkl.com/' target='_blank'>https://all-inkl.com/</a>; <strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> <a href='https://all-inkl.com/datenschutzinformationen/' target='_blank'>https://all-inkl.com/datenschutzinformationen/</a>. <strong>Data Processing Agreement:</strong> Provided by the service provider.</li></ul><h2 id='contact'>Contact and Request Management</h2><p>When contacting us (e.g., by post, contact form, email, telephone, or via social media) as well as within the framework of existing user and business relationships, the details of the requesting persons are processed as far as this is necessary to answer the contact requests and any requested measures.</p><ul class='m-elements'><li><strong>Types of Data Processed:</strong> Contact data (e.g., postal and email addresses or telephone numbers); Content data (e.g., textual or visual messages and posts as well as the information concerning them, such as details on authorship or time of creation).

For example, usage profiles can be created based on usage behavior and the resulting interests of users. The latter may in turn be used to place advertisements within and outside the networks that presumably correspond to the interests of users. For this purpose, cookies are usually stored on users' computers, in which usage behavior and interests of users are stored.

The provider of the fonts is informed of the user's IP address so that the fonts can be made available in the user's browser. In addition, technical data (language settings, screen resolution, operating system, hardware used) is transmitted, which is necessary for providing the fonts depending on the devices used and the technical environment. These data can be processed on a server of the font provider in the USA - When visiting our online offer, users' browsers send their browser HTTP requests to the Google Fonts Web API (i.e., a software interface for retrieving the fonts). The Google Fonts Web API provides users with the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) from Google Fonts and then the fonts specified in the CSS. These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by the respective user for access to the Internet, (2) the requested URL on the Google server, and (3) the HTTP headers, including the user agent, which describes the browser and operating system versions of the website visitors, as well as the referrer URL (i.e., the website on which the Google font is to be displayed). IP addresses are neither logged nor stored on Google servers and they are not analyzed. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of the HTTP requests (requested URL, user agent, and referrer URL). Access to this data is restricted and strictly controlled. The requested URL identifies the font families for which the user wants to load fonts. These data are logged so that Google can determine how often a specific font family is requested. In the Google Fonts Web API, the user agent must adapt the font generated for the respective browser type. The user agent is primarily logged for debugging and used to generate aggregate usage statistics with which the popularity of font families is measured. These summarized usage statistics are published on the 'Analytics' page of Google Fonts. Finally, the referrer URL is logged so that the data can be used for production maintenance and an aggregate report on the top integrations based on the number of font requests can be generated. According to its own information, Google does not use any of the information collected by Google Fonts to create profiles of end users or to serve targeted advertisements; <strong>Service Provider:</strong> Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; <span class=''><strong>Legal Bases:</strong> Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR); </span><strong>Website:</strong> <a href='https://fonts.google.com/' target='_blank'>https://fonts.google.com/</a>; <strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> <a href='https://policies.google.com/privacy' target='_blank'>https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>; <strong>Basis for Third-Country Transfers:</strong> Data Privacy Framework (DPF). <strong>Further Information:</strong> <a href='https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy?hl=en' target='_blank'>https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy?hl=en</a>.</li></ul><h2 id='changes'>Changes and Updates</h2><p>We ask you to inform yourself regularly about the content of our privacy policy.
